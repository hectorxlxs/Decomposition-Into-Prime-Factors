# Decomposition Into Prime Factors
This program allows you to decompose a number you introduce into prime factors.

## "Installing" the program step by step
1. Install c++ compiler (I used MinGW version 5.3.0).
2. Download the .cpp file and the primes.txt file into the same folder.
3. Open windows terminal and go to the .cpp location.
4. Write on terminal "g++ filename.cpp"
5. Then, execute the a.exe that has been created.
